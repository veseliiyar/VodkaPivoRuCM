/// Building overhaul (z-level): per-map opt-out switch for vertical building.
///
/// By DEFAULT the building overhaul treats <b>every</b> map as z-buildable - digging down lazily creates a
/// stone level below and links it into a CMU z-network on demand, so the feature works even on maps that
/// were authored as single-z (not multi-z). This component does not need to be added for the feature to work.
///
/// HOW TO MAKE A MAP "NOT MULTI-Z" (opt a map out of vertical building):
///   Add this component to the map prototype with <c>enabled: false</c>, e.g.
///
///       - type: entity
///         id: MyMapThatShouldStaySingleZ
///         ...
///         components:
///         - type: ZBuildableMap
///           enabled: false
///
///   With <c>enabled: false</c>, <see cref="Content.Server.CMU14.ZLevelBuilding.ZLevelBuildingSystem"/> will
///   refuse to bootstrap a level below or generate stone for that map, leaving it strictly single-z.
///
/// To disable the feature globally in code (all maps), set
/// <c>ZLevelBuildingSystem.GloballyEnabled = false</c> instead.
