/// A crucible that renders ore into sheets over a lit fire.

/// Design notes, because they explain most of the shape of this component:
///  * The pot holds ONE material at a time. That is what removes the need for any recipe picker: what you put
///    in decides what it is smelting, so there is no mode to set and no mode to set wrongly.
///  * Finished sheets land in a separate OUTPUT buffer and are never fed back in, so an ore load cannot run
///    away into plasteel on its own. Refining a second step is a deliberate act: take the sheets out, put
///    them back in.
///  * Capacity is counted in MATERIAL UNITS, not entities - ore is a stack type, so one entity can be thirty
///    ore and an entity cap would mean nothing.
