///     A CLF Sapper trap: an item that is deployed onto a tile where it hides itself, arms after a short
///     delay, and then fires (via the entity's own trigger components, e.g. an explosion on step) when a
///     non-CLF mob steps on it. CLF members are immune, so the cell can walk over its own field freely.
///
///     This component only owns the placement, arming, hiding, and friendly-gating behavior. What the trap
///     actually does when it goes off is left to the ordinary trigger components on the prototype
///     (TriggerOnStepTrigger + ExplodeOnTrigger, a flash, a spawn, and so on), so new trap types are just
///     new prototypes with this component plus whatever payload the author wants.
