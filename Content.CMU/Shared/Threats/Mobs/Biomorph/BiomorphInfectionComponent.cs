///     A silent marker applied to a humanoid hit by an abomination (or injected
///     with abomination venom). There are no visible symptoms — no cough, no
///     jitter, no vomit, no drunkenness, no scream — so neither the host nor
///     anyone around them can tell they carry it. The infection still works
///     quietly: a poison tick drains the host until they die, and any
///     death while infected reclaims the body as an abomination (seeding flesh
///     kudzu at the corpse). The flesh roots in one limb — severing that limb
///     while the infection is still local cures it (the limb is destroyed,
///     prosthetic or nothing); past that window it goes systemic, the poison
///     ramps past what anti-toxin can hold, and only the WY counteragent
///     still cures. There is no free timeout.
