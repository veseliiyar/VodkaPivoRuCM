### Code

The **May 1, 2026** licensing cutoff was introduced in
[commit 08ae7902c0c4][license-cutoff] ("Revise license information"):

- The vast majority of code implemented **before May 1, 2026** is licensed under the
  [MIT License][historical-mit].
- All code implemented **on or after May 1, 2026** is licensed under the
  [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)](LICENSE), unless noted otherwise.

The repository's `LICENSE.TXT` was subsequently changed from MIT to AGPL-3.0 on **May 13, 2026**, in
[commit f41c414ca0ec][license-file-change]. The cutoff above comes from the earlier README change.
